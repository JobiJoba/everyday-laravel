It was just because I didn't had the Storage class imported.
Where does it store the file?

If we are using lambda or serverless we have to attach a volume there.

### PHPStorm with Laravel IDEA

It seems to be a must when you are in a professional project world.
It will cost 123 usd per year which is not that high (with Laravel Idea)

### Tailwind Prettier

It's working ! in the blade files!
I had to install another plugin  https://github.com/shufo/prettier-plugin-blade

Set the blade.php in settings of PHPStorm and restart mutliple times.
