# Day 8

- Continue watching video of TALL Stack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul3sfSDEt9U
- Read about Fly.io documentation
- Read doc of Laravel Bref.

The idea is to deploy soon an app on Fly.io first and try to launch processes and see what happens.

Fly.io seems to manage workers ... so I'm wondering if I could create quickly a project that I deployed and generate
like 100 workers running to see what happens.

I think I'll go the road of Fly.io first.
