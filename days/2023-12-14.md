### Authentication

- Auth::check()
- Will probably use a middleware to know show route if user authenticated
- Password confirmation for sensible action
- Laravel dispatch event when user login/logout and other ...

### Authorization

Two concept - Gates and Policies
Better practice to use Policies instead of Gates.

Comparing to previous framework I had to work with, this seems to be a big subject to consider.
When defining my idea of project, I will have to think about this very carefully.

Auto Discovery of policies if you follow laravel convention
No need to do this in AuthServiceProvider
`ToTestPolicy::class => ToTestPolicyPolicy::class`

Have a middleware also

`Route::put('/post/{post}', function (Post $post) {})->middleware('can:update,post');`
or
`Route::put('/post/{post}', function (Post $post) {})->can('update', 'post');`

In blade file:

```php
@if (Auth::user()->can('update', $post))
    <!-- The current user can update the post... -->
@endif
 
@unless (Auth::user()->can('update', $post))
    <!-- The current user cannot update the post... -->
@endunless
```

### Databases

- Can put multiple configuration for database and then selection which connection
  `$users = DB::connection('sqlite')->select(/* ... */);`

- Pluck to get one or multiple value of a row
  `$titles = DB::table('roles')->pluck('title');`

If you want a UUID as a primary key instead of ID:

```php
use HasUUids on a model 
and change migration id to uuid('id');

```
