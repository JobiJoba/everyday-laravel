    - I could do an Astro website with markdown...
- Speak with the creator of Spike https://spike.opcodes.io/

## Goal of the day

- Finish Laravel Basic docs - Start with Advanced if possible

### Blade

- This : syntax is for if you pass php value to the component.

```php 
<x-alert type="error" :message="$message"/>
```

- The double ::class is not super clear. Would be nice to have example

### Asset Bundling (Vite)

Ziggy provides a JavaScript route() function that works like Laravel's, making it a breeze to use your named Laravel
routes in JavaScript

- https://github.com/tighten/ziggy

Have to look how to optimize image with Vite and Laravel
in the doc: https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/vite#correcting-dev-server-urls

### Url Generation

url() helper

- current()
- previous()

if you named your route you can then do something like this:

- echo route('post.show', ['post' => 1]);
- echo route('post.show', ['post' => $post]);  (eloquent model)

Signed url

- URL::signedRoute('unsubscribe', ['user' => 1]);
- URL::temporarySignedRoute(
  'unsubscribe', now()->addMinutes(30), ['user' => 1]
  );
- $request->hasValidSignature()
- Can use the middleware also to validate signature

### Session

By default file
if load balancing go for a db or redis

### Validation

Use old on value if we flush the data and validation fail

- <input type="text" name="title" value="{{ old('title') }}">
- Optional value should be put as nullable (because of trim etc)
- Conditional validation (exclude_if:has_appointment,false)
- More complex validation rule
  ```php
  use Illuminate\Support\Fluent;

$validator->sometimes('reason', 'required|max:500', function (Fluent $input) {
return $input->games >= 100;
});```

### Collection

Funny syntax for collection

```php 
$collection = collect(['taylor', 'abigail', null])->map(function (string $name) {
    return strtoupper($name);
})->reject(function (string $name) {
    return empty($name);
});
```

Can create macro

### Notifications

Can create notifications for mail / slack/ sms / database / ...

### Laravel Medialibrary from Spatie

When I was in packages doc they spoke about this package.
Apparently manage responsive image - should look deeper into it.
